## Skills
* React
* Redux
* MongoDB (NoSQL)

* Koa
* SCSS
* AWS (EC2 ubuntu)


## Functional Objective
React Blog App is a pure React blog with well use of SASS (preprocessor of CSS) and deployment on an Ubuntu Linux AWS EC2 instance.  I've wanted to create a website where everyone can share their everyday study like Medium, the online publishing platform.


## Technical Objective
To have a hands-on experience of friendly UI and take advantage of AWS. 


##### Frontend:
Coded in React and Redux for the state management, with CSS preprocessor (SCSS) for styling and responsive design.
Also this app uses Yarn to build and manage dependecies.

##### Backend
This app uses AWS EC2 for the deployment through Ubuntu Linux and MongDB (NoSQL) for database with Mongoose.
